# Reimplemented BenjaminHinchliff.com with Rust

this is an experimental reimplementation of my website made with yew, rust, and webpack. It was an iteresting exercise, but I think I'm going to stick with vue for my actual website. Might use yew for other projects though, as it's really nice to use in most cases.
